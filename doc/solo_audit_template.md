## About {Auditor Handle}
I'm an Independent security researcher.

## Disclaimer
Smart contracts are an experimental technology with many known and unknown risks. MrP3lt assumes no responsibility for any misbehavior, bugs or exploits affecting the audited code or any part of the deployment phase.
Furthermore, it is known to all parties that changes to the audited code, including fixes of issues highlighted in this report, may introduce new issues and require further auditing.

## Methodology
In general, the primary methodology used is manual auditing. The entire in-scope code has
been deeply looked at and considered from many different adversarial perspectives. Any additional dependencies on external code have also been reviewed.

# Q&A to Customer?
1. If you have a public code repo, please share it here:
2. How many contracts are in scope?
3. Total SLoC for these contracts?
4. Is it a fork of a popular project? What is the original project?
5. Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? 
6. Which ERC721 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? 
7. Which ERC777 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? 
8. Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
9. Are there any REBASING tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
10. Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
11. Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
12. What is the overall line coverage percentage provided by your tests?:
13. Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?: 
14. Please describe required context:
14. Are there any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models?
16. Does it use an oracle?
17. On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
18. Please list any known issues/acceptable risks that should not result in a valid finding.
19. In case of external protocol integrations, are the risks of external contracts pausing or executing an emergency withdrawal acceptable? If not,{Auditor Handle} will submit issues related to these situations that can harm your protocol's functionality.
