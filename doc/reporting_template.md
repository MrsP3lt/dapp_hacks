- High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals). Issues that impact individual users where exploitation would pose reputational, legal or moderate financial risk to the user.

- Medium: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.

- Low/Informational: The issue does not pose an immediate risk but is relevant to security best practices.

- Gas Issues: Issues that are not security related but can save gas.
